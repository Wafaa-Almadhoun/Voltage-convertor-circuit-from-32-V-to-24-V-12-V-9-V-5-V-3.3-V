## Introduction

 this projects for working with standard power supply 32V , 
 while certain electronic devices, components, ICâ€™s,   sensors ,
 motors or microcontrollers designed to work on 12V , 9V , 5V ,3.3V DC supply
 as a power source.so we will made a circuit supply several voltiges 
 
  


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Proteus [To Downloud](https://www.labcenter.com/simulation/)
